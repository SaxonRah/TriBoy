# TriBoy - (TMA - Three Microcontroller Architecture)
A handheld game console using RP2040s/RP2350 (Pico/Pico2).

## CPU Microcontroller: Main Processing and Logic
The first (Pico/Pico2) would serve as the central processing unit:
- Game Logic: Run the main game loop, handle game state, physics calculations, and AI
- Input Handling: Process button/D-pad inputs with debouncing
- Resource Management: Load game assets from storage (SD card via SPI)
- Command Dispatch: Send rendering commands to the GPU and sound commands to the audio chip

Implementation details:
- Core 0: Main game loop and logic processing
- Core 1: Asset management and communication with other micros
- Communication: SPI master to both GPU and sound chips
- Command protocol: Command byte followed by data payload

The CPU would send compact, optimized commands like "draw sprite X at position Y,Z" or "scroll background layer by N pixels" rather than raw frame data, minimizing bandwidth requirements.

## GPU Microcontroller: Graphics Processing
The second (Pico/Pico2) would handle all display-related tasks:
- Layer Management: Implement multiple background layers with independent scrolling for parallax effects
- Tile Engine: Handle tile-based backgrounds common in retro games
- Sprite System: Manage sprite rendering, animation, and transformation
- Compositing: Combine all layers into the final frame

Implementation approach:
- Core 0: Handle background rendering and tile management
- Core 1: Process sprites and final compositing
- Memory: Divide the 264KB SRAM for framebuffer, tile cache, and sprite data
- Display interface: SPI or parallel connection to the actual display
  
The PIO (Programmable I/O) blocks in the (Pico/Pico2) are perfect for implementing custom display protocols, allowing you to drive various display types efficiently.

For layer implementation:
- Background layers: Tile-based with 8x8 or 16x16 pixel tiles
- Parallax scrolling: Different scroll speeds per layer
- Sprite layer: Support 32-64 hardware sprites with attributes
- Foreground layer: For UI elements, score display, etc.
  
Optimization techniques could include dirty rectangle tracking (only updating changed portions of the screen) and clipping to avoid rendering off-screen elements.

## Sound Microcontroller: Audio Processing
The third (Pico/Pico2) would serve as a dedicated sound processor:
- Synthesis Engine: Implement multiple synthesis methods (wavetable, FM synthesis)
- Sample Playback: Play PCM sound effects with pitch control
- Tracker/Sequencer: Run a music tracker for background music
- Mixing: Mix multiple audio channels with volume control

Implementation specifics:
- Core 0: Sound synthesis and sample playback
- Core 1: Sequencer/tracker control and command processing
- Audio output: PWM or I2S (using PIO) to DAC and amplifier
- Memory allocation: Sample data, sequencer patterns, synthesis buffers
  
The tracker/sequencer would support:
- Multiple channels (8-16)
- Pattern-based composition
- Note events, instrument selection, effects 
- Tempo control synced with gameplay

The PIO blocks could implement I2S protocol for high-quality audio output to an external DAC, or you could use PWM with filtering for a simpler solution.
Inter-Microcontroller Communication

The three (Pico/Pico2)s would communicate primarily through SPI:
- CPU as SPI master
- GPU and sound chips as SPI slaves
- Additional GPIO pins for synchronization signals
- Command buffers to queue operations
  
The CPU would send compact command packets rather than raw data, allowing each processor to focus on its specialty while minimizing communication overhead.

## Advantages of the (Pico/Pico2) for This Design
The (Pico/Pico2) works well for this architecture because:
- Dual-core ARM Cortex-M0+/Arm Cortex-M33 processors allow parallel processing within each chip
- PIO blocks enable custom protocols for displays, audio, and inter-chip communication
- 264KB/520 KB on-chip SRAM provides enough memory for respective tasks when properly allocated
- DMA controllers enable efficient data movement without CPU overhead
- Consistent architecture across all three chips simplifies development
